# Hack 4
It is now your turn to implement your own hacks!! We know this may be a daunting step, so we created some skeleton code you can use.We also encourage you to look through the source file.

Here is a quick explanation of the files in this directory that will help you build your Hack 4 implementation.

- [a_Hack4.js](#a_Hack4.js)
- [hack_4_function](#hack_4_function)
- [check_hack4_calls.js](#check_hack4_calls.js)
- [check_hack4_strings.js](#check_hack4_strings.js)

This file is where you can write your script. There is a skeleton code that walks through all the different techniques to build your script and scene.

## hack_4_function.js
This file is where you write the function/code  players need to fix in order to solve the hack.
