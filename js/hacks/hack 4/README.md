# Hack 4
It is now your turn to implement your own hacks!! We know this may be a daunting step, so we created some skeleton code you can use.We also encourage you to look through the source file.

### Files to use

Here is a quick explanation of the files in this directory that will help you build your Hack 4 implementation.

- [a_Hack4.js](#a_Hack4.js)
- [hack_4_function](#hack_4_function)
- [check_hack4.js](#check_hack4.js)



## a_Hack4.js
This file is where you can write your script. There is a skeleton code that walks through all the different techniques to build your script and scene.

## hack_4_function.js
This file is where you write the function/code  players need to fix in order to solve the hack.
## check_hack4.js
This file is used to check if players have solved the hack correctly. Currently, the check for this level is always true and does not stop players if they haven't solved the 
hack. As you are the designer of this level it is your job to write a conditional statement to block players from continuing 
without solving the hack.



If in your hack 4 function implementation there is a certain string output players need to achieve to solve the hack, use this function to check if the player solved the hack correctly.
